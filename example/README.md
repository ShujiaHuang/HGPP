CAUTION
-------

All the folders here are just some examples to show how to use HGPP in our project, do not guarantee the results here will be the same with that ones in our publish paper, cause by updating the result several times

And we should keep runing this order:     
step 1: Find the fosmid region            -- "anchor_fosmid"      
step 2: Markers error correction          -- "phasing"          
step 3: Fosmid initial connection         -- "phasing"        
step 4: RefHap phasing process            -- "phasing"       
step 5: haplotype genome reconstruction   -- "reconstruct_haplotype_genome"    
step 6: ASE and ASM                       -- "ASE" and "ASM"
