Input files for phasing process
===============================

In 'input' directory:

__scaffold206.wgs.het.snp:__ Het SNPs of **scaffold206** created by aligning WGS PE reads of YH to YHref  
__fosmid_pileup:__ The pileup files of each fosmid's pooling, created by aligning all the raw fosmid pooling sequencing reads to YHref   
__YH2.depth.abnormal:__ Abnormal depth cover regions. You can generate this file yourself base on the alignment result    
__fosmid_regions.lst:__ The file list of fosmid regions, created in anchor_fosmid process
